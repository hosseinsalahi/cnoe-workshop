# Best Practices and Troubleshooting for CNOE

Welcome to the final section of the CNOE workshop, where we’ll cover some essential best practices for managing your internal platform with CNOE, along with troubleshooting tips for common issues you may encounter during deployment and platform operation.

## Best Practices for CNOE

To ensure smooth operation and optimal performance of your internal developer platform, it's important to follow a few key best practices:

### 1. **Use Declarative Configurations**
CNOE is built around the principle of **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC). Always define your platform components, services, and cloud infrastructure using declarative configuration files (YAML, JSON, etc.). This ensures consistency, version control, and easy replication across environments.

- Store all configurations in a version control system (e.g., Git) for tracking and collaboration.
- Use tools like **Helm** or **Kustomize** for templating reusable configurations.

### 2. **Environment-Specific Configuration Management**
To streamline platform operations, maintain separate configurations for each environment (development, staging, production), and use environment overrides when needed. This ensures that scaling, resource allocation, and deployment strategies are tailored to the unique requirements of each environment.

- Example: Use fewer replicas in development, and scale up resources in production to handle higher loads.
- Always test your changes in a staging environment before deploying them to production.

### 3. **Monitor and Maintain Observability**
A well-observed platform is a healthy platform. Use monitoring tools to track performance, resource usage, and application health.

- Integrate **Prometheus** and **Grafana** with CNOE to visualize resource usage and detect performance bottlenecks.
- Set up logging and alerting mechanisms for key metrics and error states.
- Use tools like **Backstage** to provide an observability layer, so teams can easily access deployment and resource status.

### 4. **Automation via CI/CD Pipelines**
Take full advantage of CI/CD pipelines to automate your deployment process. With CNOE, CI/CD automation enables seamless and error-free deployments by following predefined steps.

- Use **GitOps** principles, where configuration changes in Git trigger automatic deployments.
- Integrate with **Argo Workflows** or **Jenkins** to orchestrate CI/CD pipelines, ensuring a consistent release cycle.

### 5. **Security and Access Control**
When dealing with cloud infrastructure and platform services, ensure that appropriate security measures are in place to safeguard your systems.

- Apply **role-based access control (RBAC)** to Kubernetes clusters to restrict access based on roles.
- Always encrypt sensitive data, such as API keys and credentials, and manage them securely using Kubernetes **Secrets** or **Vault**.
- Regularly audit permissions and ensure least privilege access.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

Even with best practices in place, you might encounter issues. Below are common problems and steps to resolve them:

### 1. **Kubernetes Resources Not Deploying**
If resources (e.g., pods, services) are not being deployed correctly in Kubernetes:
- **Check for YAML Syntax Errors**: Use `kubectl apply --dry-run` to validate the configuration before applying it.
- **Review Kubernetes Logs**: Use `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to check the pod logs for any deployment-related errors.
- **Resource Quotas**: Ensure that your environment has enough resources (CPU, memory) to accommodate new deployments. Check `kubectl describe namespace <namespace-name>` for resource limits.

### 2. **Application Failing to Connect to Cloud Resources**
If your application is not connecting to cloud resources (e.g., databases, storage):
- **Check Configuration Secrets**: Ensure that correct cloud provider credentials (AWS, GCP, Azure) are configured and accessible in Kubernetes Secrets.
- **Network Connectivity**: Validate that the network policies or firewall rules allow communication between your application and the cloud resources.
- **Provisioning Errors**: Review the logs and status of any resources created via **Crossplane** or other IaC tools to verify that they were provisioned successfully.

### 3. **Slow Deployment Times**
If deployments are taking too long:
- **Monitor Resource Usage**: Check if the cluster has enough CPU and memory available (`kubectl top nodes`) and scale up your resources if needed.
- **Container Image Pull Issues**: If pulling container images is slow, verify your image registry’s connectivity and ensure that images are properly cached locally.
- **Pod Scheduling**: Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to check if there are any issues with pod scheduling (e.g., not enough resources, node affinity issues).

### 4. **CI/CD Pipeline Failures**
If your CI/CD pipeline fails:
- **Check Pipeline Logs**: Review the logs in the CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins, Argo Workflows) to identify the root cause of the failure.
- **Resource Conflicts**: Ensure that no conflicting deployments or resource constraints exist that could cause the pipeline to fail.
- **Credentials Issues**: Ensure that the pipeline has the correct permissions and credentials to access your Kubernetes cluster and cloud provider.
